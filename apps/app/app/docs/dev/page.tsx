        What it is
      </H2>
      <P>
        resell.store is a marketplace where every seller gets their own shop on a subdomain, like <C>maya.resell.store</C>, and an AI
        agent that researches prices, writes listings, answers buyers and haggles within limits the seller sets. Buyers pay through
        PayPal, the money is held until the item arrives, and then it&apos;s released to the seller.
      </P>
      <P>
        It was built for the <A href="https://paypalaihackathon.devpost.com/">PayPal AI Hackathon</A>, and it&apos;s open source under
        the MIT license. The code is on <A href="https://github.com/impactvelocity/resell-store">GitHub</A>.
      </P>

      <H2 id="parts">The moving parts</H2>
      <P>It&apos;s deliberately small: one app, one database, one job runner.</P>
      <UL>
        <li>
          <strong>One Next.js app</strong> (<C>apps/app</C>) serves everything people and programs reach: the marketplace, every store
          subdomain, the seller app, checkout, the public API, these docs and the hosted MCP servers. <C>proxy.ts</C> looks at the
          host name and sends each request to the right part of the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Postgres with pgvector</strong> holds all of it, including uploads when there&apos;s no object storage. The schema and
          migrations live in <C>packages/db</C> (Drizzle).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A Render Workflow</strong> (<C>apps/app/workflows/main.ts</C>) runs the timed jobs: expiring offers, reminders,
          cancelling unshipped orders, releasing held money, digests and webhook retries. A Render Cron Job starts it every 15
          minutes. Without Render, one HTTP call runs the same jobs in-process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Work that shouldn&apos;t slow a page down</strong> (research, the store agent&apos;s answers, counter-offers, emails)
          runs in the web process after the response is sent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Packages</strong> beside the app: <C>@repo/db</C>, <C>@repo/ui</C> (the design system), <C>@repo/email</C> (React
          Email templates) and <C>@repo/mcp</C> (the MCP servers, built on the public API).
        </li>
      </UL>

      <H2 id="map">Where a request goes</H2>
      <P>
        One deployment answers on the root domain and a wildcard. The host decides which part of the app handles the request; the
        path does the rest.
      </P>

      <H2 id="services">Outside services</H2>
      <P>
        Only Postgres and an auth secret are required. Every other service switches a feature on, and the app has a fallback
        without it, so you can run the whole thing locally with no keys at all.
