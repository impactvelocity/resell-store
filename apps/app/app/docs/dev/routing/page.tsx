        All of this is one Render web service with two custom domains, <C>resell.store</C> and <C>*.resell.store</C>. The
        wildcard covers stores and the three service hosts alike. The root domain comes from <C>NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN</C>, so a
        copy on another domain works the same way.
      </P>

      <H2 id="proxy">What proxy.ts does</H2>
      <P>
        <C>apps/app/proxy.ts</C> is Next.js 16&apos;s middleware. It runs on every request except Next internals and static files,
        in this order:
      </P>
      <OL>
        <li>
          <strong>Service hosts.</strong> On <C>api.</C>, <C>docs.</C> or <C>mcp.</C> it rewrites the path (above) and stops.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pass-through.</strong> Anything under <C>/api/</C> is left alone, on every host. That&apos;s why
          the session routes and API calls work on store subdomains too.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Marketplace host.</strong> <C>/store/maya/dutch-oven</C> redirects to <C>maya.resell.store/dutch-oven</C>, so
          store links can stay relative. Share images (<C>opengraph-image</C>, <C>twitter-image</C>) are served in place, because
          that&apos;s where <C>og:image</C> points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Store host, dev only.</strong> On a full page load with no session cookie and no recent attempt, it starts the
          session handoff (below).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Store host.</strong> Everything else is rewritten to <C>/store/{"{store}"}{"{path}"}</C>. The browser never sees <C>/store/</C>.
        </li>
      </OL>
      <P>
        The proxy never checks who&apos;s signed in. Layouts and pages do that with <C>requireUser()</C> or{" "}
        <C>getCurrentUser()</C>. Tests for all of the above are in <C>proxy.test.ts</C> and <C>lib/urls.test.ts</C>.
      </P>

      <H2 id="reserved">Reserved names</H2>
      <P>
        <C>www</C>, <C>app</C>, <C>api</C>, <C>docs</C> and <C>mcp</C> are never stores (<C>reserved</C> in{" "}
        <C>lib/urls.ts</C>). <C>www.</C> and <C>app.</C> fall through to the marketplace. Hosts with more than one label before the
        root, like <C>a.b.resell.store</C>, aren&apos;t stores either.
      </P>

      <H2 id="links">Linking between zones</H2>
      <P>
        A store page and a marketplace page are on different origins, so a client-side <C>next/link</C> between them can&apos;t work.
        Two helpers handle it:
      </P>
      <Table
        head={["Helper", "Use it for"]}
        rows={[
          [<C key="a">{"<SiteLink href=\"/discover\">"}</C>, "A marketplace path. A next/link on the marketplace, an absolute <a> inside a store"],
          [<C key="b">{"<StoreLink store=\"maya\" href=\"/dutch-oven\">"}</C>, "A path in a store. A next/link inside that store, an absolute <a> everywhere else"],
        ]}
      />
      <P>
        Both live in <C>components/market/links.tsx</C> and know where they are from <C>StoreZone</C>, which{" "}
        <C>app/store/[store]/layout.tsx</C> wraps around every store page. On the server, or for emails and redirects, build URLs
        with <C>lib/urls.ts</C>:
      </P>
      <Table
        head={["Function", "Production", "Localhost"]}

      <P>
        <C>storeFromHost()</C> and <C>serviceFromHost()</C> read a Host header; <C>zoneUrl()</C> checks that a URL points at the
        marketplace or one of its stores, which is how redirects after sign-in stay on resell.store.
      </P>

      <H2 id="auth">Sign-in across subdomains</H2>
      <P>
        In production, Better Auth sets the session cookie on <C>.resell.store</C> (<C>crossSubDomainCookies</C> in{" "}
        <C>lib/server/auth.ts</C>), so every store reads the same session. The root and <C>*.resell.store</C> are trusted origins.
      </P>
      <P>
        On localhost that can&apos;t work: browsers won&apos;t send a <C>Domain=localhost</C> cookie to <C>maya.localhost</C>. So in
        dev each store gets its own copy of the session through a one-time token:
      </P>
      <OL>
        <li>
          The first page load on <C>maya.localhost:5689</C> with no session goes to that store&apos;s{" "}
          <C>/api/session/handoff?to=…</C>, and the proxy sets <C>rs_handoff</C> for 10 minutes so it won&apos;t ask again.
        </li>
        <li>The store&apos;s handoff route forwards to the marketplace&apos;s, where the session cookie is.</li>
        <li>
          Signed in there: it mints a Better Auth one-time token (single use, one minute) and redirects to{" "}
          <C>maya.localhost:5689/api/session/accept?token=…&amp;next=…</C>. Signed out: straight back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <C>accept</C> verifies the token, sets the store&apos;s own cookie for the same session row, and redirects to{" "}
          <C>next</C>. Any failure just arrives signed out.
        </li>
      </OL>
      <P>
        Because both cookies point at the same session row, signing out anywhere ends both (once the 5-minute cookie cache on the
        other host runs out).
      </P>

          Stores are <C>{"{slug}"}.localhost:5689</C>. Chrome, Firefox and Safari resolve <C>*.localhost</C> to your machine with

        Keep <C>NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN</C> as <C>localhost:5689</C> locally. A dotted dev root (like <C>lvh.me</C>) would share the
