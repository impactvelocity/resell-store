        Render&apos;s managed Postgres 17 has pgvector available. The first migration (<C>0000_enable-pgvector</C>) switches it on;
        listings get a <C>vector(1024)</C> column with an HNSW cosine index, which search uses next to Postgres full text. The web

          <strong>One order can&apos;t hold up the rest.</strong> Each release and each cancellation is its own task run. If PayPal
          refuses one, that order alone retries, while the others are already paid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Failures retry on their own.</strong> <C>releaseDue</C> throws when PayPal won&apos;t release yet, so Render tries
          again with backoff, up to six more times over about an hour, without anyone watching. Anything still unpaid is picked up by
          the next sweep.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retrying is safe.</strong> Every money call carries a <C>PayPal-Request-Id</C>, and every step checks the
          order&apos;s status first, so a retry or a doubled run never pays or refunds twice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Promises are kept on time.</strong> Buyers are told they&apos;ll be refunded if it doesn&apos;t ship in 7 days, and
          sellers that they&apos;re paid 13 days after shipping if the buyer doesn&apos;t confirm sooner. Those are timers that have
          to fire, and must happen before
          PayPal&apos;s 28-day hold runs out.
