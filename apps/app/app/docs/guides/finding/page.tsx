        Search in your own words

      <P>
        The search box at the top, <strong>Search things, stores and sellers</strong>, always looks across the whole marketplace,
        even when you&apos;re on one shop&apos;s page. You don&apos;t need the exact name of what you want.
      </P>
      <P>
        Every search runs two ways at once. One matches your words against listing titles, descriptions and shop names. The other
        looks for things that mean what you typed, so &quot;something to cook a stew in&quot; can turn up Maya&apos;s yellow Le
        Creuset dutch oven even though the word &quot;stew&quot; isn&apos;t in the listing. The two sets of results are blended,
        and weak guesses are left out.
      </P>
      <Callout tone="tip">
        Say what matters to you: &quot;a linen dress for summer weddings&quot; or &quot;film camera for a beginner&quot; works better
        than a single word.
      </Callout>

      <H2 id="filters">Filters and sort</H2>
      <P>
        <A href={siteUrl("/discover")}>Shop</A> shows everything for sale, 16 at a time. Tap <strong>Show more things</strong> to
        keep going. Narrow it down with:

          ["Category", "Everything, Clothing, Shoes, Bags, Home, Collectibles, Books, Tech, Kids, Garden"],
          ["Price", "Any price, Under $25, $25 to $100, Over $100"],

      <P>
        Your filters live in the page address. Copy it from your browser and send it to someone, and they&apos;ll see the same
        search with the same filters.
      </P>
      <P>
        Only live listings from open, public shops show up in search. Some sellers share a listing or a whole shop by link only;
        those never appear in search, but the link still works for anyone who has it.
      </P>

      <H2 id="stores">Stores and store pages</H2>

        <A href={siteUrl("/stores")}>Stores</A> lists every public shop, busiest first, with its rating, where it is, how many
        things are for sale and how many have sold. A new shop with nothing up yet says <strong>Opening soon</strong>.

      <P>
        Every shop has its own address, like <strong>maya.resell.store</strong>. On a store page you&apos;ll find:

        <li>The shop&apos;s picture, name, stars, where it is and when it started selling, plus a short bio.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow</strong>, <strong>Message</strong> the owner, and <strong>Share</strong>, which copies the shop&apos;s
          link.
        </li>
        <li>Three tabs: <strong>For sale</strong>, <strong>Sold</strong> and <strong>Reviews</strong>, with a search just for that shop.</li>

          <strong>What buyers say</strong>: reviews from people who actually bought there. Nobody else can leave one.
        </li>
      </UL>
      <P>
        If a shop says its owner is taking a break, the shop is paused. You can look around, but nothing can be bought or offered
        on until they reopen.

      <H3>The buy box</H3>
      <UL>

          The price, then shipping: &quot;plus $X tracked shipping&quot;, or &quot;pickup in&quot; a city when the seller hands
          it over in person.
        </li>

        Once something sells it drops out of search, but its page stays up, marked <strong>Sold</strong>, with a{" "}
        <strong>Find something like it</strong> button. Store pages show recent sales under <strong>Went to new homes</strong> and
        on the <strong>Sold</strong> tab, which is a good way to see what a shop usually sells and for how much.
