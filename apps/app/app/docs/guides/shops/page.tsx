          Give it a <strong>Shop name</strong>, up to 60 characters. Your first shop starts as &quot;Your name&apos;s shop&quot;,
          so Maya&apos;s starts as &quot;Maya&apos;s shop&quot;. Change it to whatever you like, like &quot;Maya&apos;s

        Your link becomes your shop&apos;s address: &quot;maya&quot; gives you maya.resell.store. We check it as you type and tell

          It has to be one nobody else has. A few words are kept back for resell.store itself, like www, api, docs, help, shop and

      <H2 id="several">More than one shop</H2>
      <P>
        You can open as many shops as you like, say one for clothes and one for kitchen things. Each has its own name, link,
        listings and settings. Use <strong>New shop</strong> on Home to add one, and <strong>Switch shop</strong> on a shop&apos;s
        page to hop between them.
      </P>
      <P>
        A shop&apos;s page has tabs for <strong>Live</strong>, <strong>Drafts</strong> and <strong>Sold</strong>, a search box, and
        a few numbers for the week: what you made, live listings, offers waiting and views. Each draft shows how far it got, like
        &quot;Next: photos&quot;.
      </P>

      <H2 id="settings">Shop settings</H2>
      <P>Open a shop, then its settings. Under <strong>The basics</strong> you can change:</P>
      <UL>
        <li>The picture and the shop name.</li>
        <li>
          The <strong>Shop link</strong>. Careful: the old link stops working as soon as you save, so update anywhere you&apos;ve
          shared it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>About this shop</strong>, up to 300 characters, shown on your shop page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Who can see it</strong>.
        </li>
      </UL>

      <H2 id="agent">What your agent may do</H2>
      <P>
        Each shop has its own agent settings. Whatever it does, you see it in your <A href={siteUrl("/inbox")}>Inbox</A>.
      </P>
      <H3>Answer buyers&apos; questions</H3>
      <P>
        On by default. The agent replies to buyers right away using what&apos;s in your listings, and hands you anything it
        can&apos;t answer. See <A href={`${base}/guides/questions`}>Questions and your shop agent</A>.
      </P>
      <H3>Haggle on offers</H3>
      <P>
        On by default. The agent counters lowball offers, never under your lowest. Good offers wait for your yes. See{" "}
        <A href={`${base}/guides/offers`}>Offers</A>.
      </P>
      <H3>Lowest it can go</H3>
      <P>
        How far under your price the agent may go: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% or 25% off. It starts at 15%. This applies unless a listing
        says otherwise, so you can set a different lowest on any single listing.
      </P>

      <H2 id="pause">Pausing or deleting</H2>
      <P>
        Going away, or just need a break? Use <strong>Pause shop</strong> in settings. Your shop drops off the marketplace, and
        nothing in it can be bought or offered on. Anyone visiting sees that you&apos;re taking a break. Everything is kept, and{" "}
        <strong>Open shop</strong> brings it back exactly as it was.
      </P>
      <Callout tone="warn" title="Deleting can't be undone">
        <strong>Delete shop</strong> takes all its listings down and the link stops working for good. If you might come back,
        pause it instead.
