        What resell.store is
      </H2>
      <P>
        You open a shop, snap a photo of something, and an agent helps you with the rest: it works out what the thing is, looks up
        what similar ones go for, writes the listing, and answers buyers while you get on with your day. You still make every
        decision that matters, like which offers to accept.
      </P>
      <P>
        Buyers pay through PayPal, and PayPal holds the money until the item has arrived and the buyer has had a few days to check
        it. That keeps both sides safe. <A href={`${base}/guides/how-it-works`}>How a sale works</A> walks through it step by step.
      </P>

      <H2 id="sign-in">Signing in</H2>

        Go to <A href={siteUrl("/welcome")}>resell.store/welcome</A>. There are no passwords: type your email, choose{" "}
        <strong>Email me a sign-in link</strong>, and tap the link we send you. It works once and runs out after 15 minutes. If
        it has expired, ask for a new one from the same page.
      </P>
      <P>
        New here? The same link makes your account, so there&apos;s nothing separate to sign up for. You stay signed in for 30
        days on that device. We make your name from your email (maya.rivera@… becomes Maya Rivera), and you can change it any time
        under <strong>Profile and settings</strong>.

      <P>The marketplace at resell.store is where buyers browse. Its header has:</P>
      <UL>
        <li>
          <strong>Shop</strong>: everything for sale, with search and filters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stores</strong>: every public shop, busiest first.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>For your agent</strong>: send your own AI assistant shopping for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your account (your initial, top right): orders, offers, things you&apos;ve saved and shops you follow.

      <H2 id="address">Your store&apos;s own address</H2>
      <P>
        Every shop gets its own web address. If Maya calls her shop &quot;maya&quot;, it lives at maya.resell.store, and each
        listing gets its own page under it, like maya.resell.store/yellow-le-creuset-dutch-oven. Share those links anywhere. Being
        signed in on resell.store means you&apos;re signed in on every store too.
